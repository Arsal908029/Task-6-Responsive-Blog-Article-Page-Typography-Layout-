            <p>Responsive web design has come a long way since Ethan Marcotte coined the term in 2010. What started as a technique to adapt layouts to different screen sizes has evolved into a much more sophisticated approach to creating experiences that work across a myriad of devices.</p>
            
            <h2>The Evolution of Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>In the early days, responsive design was primarily about fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. While these fundamentals remain important, the approach has expanded to include much more.</p>
            
            <h3>Component-Driven Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>Instead of thinking about page-level layouts, we're now moving toward component-level responsiveness. This means each component can adapt itself based on the available space, regardless of where it appears on the page.</p>
            
            <div class="pull-quote">
                "The best responsive designs aren't just flexible—they're context-aware, delivering appropriate experiences based on device capabilities and user needs."
            </div>
            
            <h3>CSS Grid and Flexbox</h3>
            <p>The widespread adoption of CSS Grid and Flexbox has revolutionized how we create responsive layouts. These technologies give us more control and flexibility than ever before.</p>
            
            <p>Here's a simple example of a responsive grid layout:</p>
            
            <pre><code>.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}</code></pre>
            
            <h2>Emerging Trends</h2>
            <p>As we look to the future, several trends are shaping the next evolution of responsive design:</p>
            
            <h3>AI-Powered Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>Machine learning algorithms can now analyze how users interact with interfaces across devices and automatically optimize layouts for better usability.</p>
            
            <h3>Adaptive Interfaces</h3>
            <p>Interfaces that not only respond to screen size but also to context, user preferences, and even environmental conditions like lighting.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Responsive design continues to be an essential approach for web development. As devices continue to diversify, the principles of responsive design will remain crucial, even as the techniques evolve.</p>
